# Andra - Emotion Tracking Analytics

Andra is an application I built as a personal project during my third quarter at The Turing School of Software and Design.  Andra uses the users webcam and the Microsoft Emotion API to monitor a users emotions overtime and draw correlations between their behavior and their mood at work.  Users set up an experiment with a hypothosis and determine how long the experiment will be run.  At the end of the experiment Andra uses the Morris.js library to draw an easily interpreted graph charting your emotional state over time. This data can be used to answer questions such as:
  * Does that 10am coffee really make me more productive or just give me a short boost?
  * Does having a dog in the office really make me happier?
  * Is it REALLY worth my time to do 10 minutes of yoga during lunch?

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.
